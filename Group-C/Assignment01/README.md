# Expert System 

This project demonstrates a simple **Expert System**, which is a rule-based system designed to simulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific domain.

## What is an Expert System?

An **Expert System** is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to emulate the decision-making skills of a human expert. These systems rely on:
- A **Knowledge Base**: Stores facts and rules.
- An **Inference Engine**: Applies logic to the knowledge base to deduce new information or make decisions.
- A **User Interface**: Allows interaction between the user and the system.

Expert systems are widely used in various fields such as:
- Medical diagnosis
- Stock market analysis
- Employee performance evaluation
- Information management
- Help desk automation
- Airline scheduling

## Objective

This project implements an expert system for **[Insert Your Domain: e.g., Stock Market Trading / Information Management / Employee Evaluation]** using a rule-based approach in **[Python/C++]**.

## Features

- Interactive question-answer session
- Rule-based logic for recommendations
- Simple decision-making like Buy/Sell/Hold or Performance ratings
- Implemented using basic programming without external libraries

## How It Works

The system asks the user a series of questions related to the domain and provides a recommendation based on predefined rules.

### Example (Stock Market Expert System):
- Is the price trend rising?
- Is the trading volume high?
- Is market sentiment positive?
- Is there a moving average crossover?

Based on the answers, the system suggests:
- `STRONG BUY`
- `BUY`
- `HOLD`
- `SELL`
- `STRONG SELL`
