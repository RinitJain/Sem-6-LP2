# Greedy Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains implementations of Greedy Search Algorithms for selected problems. Each folder contains code, input/output examples (if applicable), and basic documentation or instructions.

## Folder Structure

### `SelectionSort/`
- Python implementation of Selection Sort using a greedy strategy.
- Example input and output.
- Simple explanation in comments.

### `JobScheduling/`
- Solves the Job Scheduling Problem using a greedy approach to maximize profit within deadlines.
- Includes sample jobs and their outputs.

### `Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm/`
- Implements Prim's Algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree.
- Graph input is hardcoded or taken via adjacency matrix.
- Shows step-by-step edge selection.

### `Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm/`
- Kruskal's Algorithm implementation using Union-Find.
- Sorts edges by weight and builds MST greedily.
- Demonstrates cycle checking.
